Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, has asked a federal judge or an emergency order that would force the special counsel, Jack Smith, to preserve all of his investigative records even as Mr. Smith moves toward shutting down the criminal cases he has brought against President-elect Donald J. Trump. Mr. Paxton’s emergency request — filed on Monday in Federal District Court in Amarillo — came as some of Mr. Trump’s allies have said they want to hold the special counsel accountable for prosecuting Mr. Trump.
